      "summary": "Science Friday explores the severe snow drought affecting the western United States, particularly Colorado and Utah, where snowpack levels are at historic lows comparable to 1976-77 and 1980-81. The episode examines how this crisis threatens water supplies for tens of millions of people across the West, with 95% of Utah's water coming from snowmelt, and discusses the broader implications for the Colorado River system, which is already stressed. Climate scientist Brad Udall explains that warmer temperatures (5°F above normal, driven by human-caused climate change) are compounding the problem, and that solving the water crisis will require fundamental changes to agriculture in the Southwest, difficult Colorado River negotiations among seven states, and likely federal intervention.",

      "summary": "This episode of Science Will Win examines the alarming rise of early-onset cancers (diagnosed before age 50), particularly colorectal cancer in young adults. The hosts present personal narratives alongside expert commentary from oncologists at Pfizer, revealing a 79% increase in early-onset cancers from 1990-2019, with colorectal cancer now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50. While dietary factors, alcohol use, and tobacco consumption may contribute, no single causative agent has been identified. The episode emphasizes the need for earlier screening (now recommended starting at age 45), improved healthcare access for young people, and specialized psychosocial support addressing unique challenges young cancer patients face, including impacts on fertility, career, and body image.",

He argues that legislators spend 40% of their work week fundraising for their parties due to incentive structures rewarding financial loyalty with committee positions and leadership advancement. Using campaign finance reforms as natural experiments, Kistner finds that states reducing fundraising demands see approximately 20% increases in major legislation, comparable to the effects of divided government. The fundraising system also systematically disadvantages working-class legislators and women in advancing to leadership positions.",

Guest Dr. Neil Goldenberg from Johns Hopkins discusses why pediatric trials are fundamentally different from adult trials due to physiological differences, vulnerability protections, and the catch-22 of needing both rigorous oversight and adequate representation. The hosts also address a recent FDA decision to refuse to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine application, which signals regulatory concerns about vaccine trial design and has broader implications for mRNA technology development.",

The discussion centers on why athletes sometimes excel or choke during high-stakes competitions like the Olympics, revealing that the brain's reward processing system (particularly the ventral striatum) can reframe high incentives as potential losses, triggering anxiety that impairs performance.

      "summary": "This Hidden Brain episode explores intelligence testing through the personal story of psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, who was labeled as having low IQ as a child despite later becoming a successful researcher. The episode examines how IQ tests were originally designed by Alfred Binet to identify students needing remediation, but were misappropriated in America to sort and rank people by innate intelligence. Kaufman discusses how intelligence is far more complex and multifaceted than IQ tests capture, including implicit learning, creativity, and social intelligence. The episode challenges assumptions about human potential and the limitations of standardized testing.",

The research was nearly derailed when the Trump administration froze USAID foreign aid in early 2025, cutting $45 million in funding just weeks before the trial was to begin. The team secured alternative funding of $2.2 million from the South African Medical Research Council and Gates Foundation, allowing them to proceed with a scaled-down trial focused on South Africa. The vaccine development is based on discovering broadly neutralizing antibodies found in some HIV-positive individuals that can neutralize up to 90% of global HIV variants.",
