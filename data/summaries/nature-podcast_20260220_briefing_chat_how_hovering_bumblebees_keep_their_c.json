  "summary": "This episode of Nature's Briefing Chat podcast discusses two recent scientific findings: a preprint study on sex differences in brain structure and function across the lifespan using fMRI data from 1,286 people aged 8-100, and research on how bumblebees thermoregulate during flight to prevent overheating. The hosts emphasize that brain differences between sexes become more pronounced at puberty and may reflect complex interactions between biological factors (hormones) and social/environmental influences. They note the controversial nature of sex difference research and caution against oversimplifying findings into categorical male/female brain types.",

    "Males show stronger interhemispheric functional connections in the cerebellum with age",
    "Women have higher frequencies of depression and anxiety; men more likely to have substance abuse issues; boys more commonly diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder—hosts acknowledge these may reflect socioeconomic, social, and environmental factors rather than purely biological sex differences",

    "Sex is just one part of why we have health disparities—with socioeconomic outcomes, sexual violence, and body shaming also contributing to brain changes",
    "The brain is more of a sort of mosaic of different features. So you might have some features are more common in men, some features are more common in women, but that there's no sort of really distinct, clear differences."

For these systems, carbon will need to be managed and utilized effectively, in a way that either prevents CO2 from entering the atmosphere or reuses it through circular processes that do not contribute additional emissions.

In late 2021 and early 2022, a recall of specific infant formula products, followed by a pause in production, resulted in a widespread, national shortage. The incident demonstrated that additional risk management planning is needed to protect infants from the consequences of potential future supply chain disruptions. In 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration contracted with the National Academies to convene an expert committee to examine and report on challenges in supply, market competition, and regulation of infant formula. The resulting consensus study report explains policy and marketplace vulnerabilities that were exposed during the shortage, describes the extent to which actions taken by relevant stakeholders addressed these vulnerabilities, identifies remaining gaps",

This is difficult and stressful work in the middle of the already stressful and sometimes traumatic backdrop of the global pandemic.

          "description": "\"Roadways intersect utility facilities above and below ground. Facilities such as water, sewer, natural gas, fiber optic, and electric lines may be impacted by highway improvement projects and often require relocation. Issues and conflicts between highway features and utility facilities can arise and impede highway construction projects, causing construction delays, economic impacts, and safety concerns. NCHRP Research Report 1110: Minimizing Utility Issues During Construction: A Guide, from TRB's National Cooperative Highway Research Program, provides practitioners with a guide to help mitigate utility conflicts using strategies such as improving pre-letting utility investigations, inspection procedures, and change order documentation.\" --Publisher's website",
