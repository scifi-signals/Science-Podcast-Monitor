  "summary": "Dr. Michael Osterholm discusses the American Medical Association and Vaccine Integrity Project's creation of an independent vaccine review panel in response to concerns about compromised CDC/ACIP decision-making under the current HHS leadership. The new panel aims to provide science-based vaccine reviews to medical societies, healthcare providers, and payers when federal advisory processes are deemed unreliable. Osterholm emphasizes this is not meant to replace the CDC but to fill a gap by synthesizing scientific literature and providing transparent, evidence-based information to support clinical decision-making during a period of institutional disruption.",

    "\"with Mr. Kennedy likely to become the secretary of HHS, they are going to come under heavy attack. And most notably, it's likely that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, what we call ACIP, an independent group of experts that advise the CDC on how vaccines should be used, would be dismantled and it would no longer be science-based. Well, that all came true.\"",
    "\"our job is not to try to replace them. We can't wait for one day for the ACIP to be reconstituted with the kind of expertise and the process that they had before. But until then, we're here and we're going to hold up our side of the bargain of making the information available.\"",
    "\"these are the most unusual times I've ever experienced in my 52 years in the business. Nothing, nothing is comparable to any experience we've had in the past.\""

It includes data on vaccination histories, health outcomes, and characteristics of more than 7 million patients of eight participating health organizations. Researchers from CDC and the managed care groups have used VSD information to study whether health problems are associated with vaccinations. The subsequent VSD data sharing program was launched in 2002 to allow independent, external researchers access to information in the database. In this report, the committee that was asked to review aspects of this program recommends that two new oversight groups are needed to ensure that the policies and procedures of the VSD and its data sharing program are implemented as fairly and openly as possible.",

The two diseases account for about a million deaths a year and 78 percent of world's hepatocellular carcinoma and more than half of all fatal cirrhosis. In 2013 viral hepatitis, of which hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) are the most common types, surpassed HIV and AIDS to become the seventh leading cause of death worldwide. The world now has the tools to prevent hepatitis B and cure hepatitis C. Perfect vaccination could eradicate HBV, but it would take two generations at least. In the meantime, there is no cure for the millions of people already infected. Conversely, there is no vaccine for HCV, but new direct-acting antivirals can cure 95 percent of chronic infections, though these drugs are unlikely to reach all chronically-infected people anytime soon. This report, the first of two, examines the feasibility of hepatitis B and C elimination in the United States and identifies criti",
