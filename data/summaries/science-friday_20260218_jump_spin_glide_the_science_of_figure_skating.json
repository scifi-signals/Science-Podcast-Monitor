  "summary": "This episode explores the biomechanics and physics underlying figure skating, focusing on the quadruple axel and other advanced technical skills performed at the Olympics. Dr. Deborah King explains how skaters use principles of physics—particularly moment of inertia, angular momentum, and torque—to execute complex aerial maneuvers in under one second of airtime. The discussion covers the interplay between physical attributes, technique, mental performance, and the extreme cardiovascular demands of competitive figure skating programs.",

  "key_quotes": [
    "The quadruple axle is a jump that is unique in that, as an axle jump, the skaters step forward and is facing forward when they jump into the air...there's actually an extra half revolution you have to complete so that you're facing backwards. So it's a four and a half revolution jump.",
    "If you're doing four and a half revolutions in a second, you're not going to be able to spot and turn your head. So having your body awareness to be able to know where you are in the air and land is obviously amazingly difficult.",
    "Every skater is constrained by the laws of physics and needs to utilize their technique to be sure that they can optimize their performance within the laws of physics."

Translating policies, investments, or built infrastructure-reshaping mandates into real and sustained local impact that incorporates accountability and culture change will require hands-on work. Adaptive societal responses to climate change will succeed or fail based on the attitudes, behaviors, social cohesion and capital, organizational and emotional strengths, and collective impact and input of all stakeholders. To consider how to integrate, align, and converge the broad mix of social, behavioral, and cognitive sciences to produce new insights and inform efforts for enhanced human responses to environmental change, Board on Environmental Change and Society of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine convened this 2023 workshop, entitled Committee on Integrating the Human Sciences to Scale Societal Responses to Environmental Change: A Workshop.

This new field brings the physicist's style of inquiry to bear on the beautiful phenomena of life. The enormous range of phenomena encountered in living systems - phenomena that often have no analog or precedent in the inanimate world - means that the intellectual agenda of biological physics is exceptionally broad, even by the ambitious standards of physics. Physics of Life is the first decadal survey of this field, as part of a broader decadal survey of physics. This report communicates the importance of biological physics research; addresses what must be done to realize the promise of this new field; and provides guidance for informed decisions about funding, workforce, and research directions.",

          "description": "The COVID-19 pandemic is resulting in widespread and ongoing changes to how the K-12 education system functions, including disruptions to science teaching and learning environments. Students and teachers are all figuring out how to do schooling differently, and districts and states are working overtime to reimagine systems and processes. This is difficult and stressful work in the middle of the already stressful and sometimes traumatic backdrop of the global pandemic. In addition, students with disabilities, students of color, immigrants, English learners, and students from under-resourced communities have been disproportionately affected, both by the pandemic itself and by the resulting instructional shifts. Teaching K-12 Science and Engineering During a Crisis aims to describe what high quality science and engineering education can look like in a time of great uncertainty and to support practitioners as they work toward their goals. This book includes guidance for science and enginee",
