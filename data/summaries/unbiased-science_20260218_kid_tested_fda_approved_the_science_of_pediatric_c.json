  "summary": "This episode examines pediatric clinical trials, their importance for developing evidence-based treatments for children, and the infrastructure challenges that impede their conduct. Guest Dr. Neil Goldenberg from Johns Hopkins discusses why pediatric trials are fundamentally different from adult trials due to physiological differences, vulnerability protections, and the catch-22 of needing both rigorous oversight and adequate representation. The hosts also address a recent FDA decision to refuse to review Moderna's mRNA flu vaccine application, which signals regulatory concerns about vaccine trial design and has broader implications for mRNA technology development.",

    "Kids really don't have a voice... it's us as caretakers, as parents, as primary physicians, subspecialists to advocate for them. But too often folks, including pharmaceutical industry, will say, well, it's too difficult to do that... And so then we have a result whereby we're treating kids off-label in many circumstances.",
    "Kids are not just small adults... pediatric trials need to account for the fact that an infant trial is probably not the same as an adolescent, post-pubertal adolescent trial because metabolism and developmental differences between kids and adults are substantial.",
    "There's a bit of a crisis currently in terms of both the mechanisms by which those trials can be funded and secondly, the infrastructure that exists to be able to run those trials rather than having to develop an infrastructure for each idea that is developed."

          "description": "The United States has long made substantial investments in clinical research with the goal of improving the health and well-being of our nation. There is no doubt that these investments have contributed significantly to treating and preventing disease and extending human life. Nevertheless, clinical research faces a critical shortcoming. Currently, large swaths of the U.S. population, and those that often face the greatest health challenges, are less able to benefit from these discoveries because they are not adequately represented in clinical research studies. While progress has been made with representation of white women in clinical trials and clinical research, there has been little progress in the last three decades to increase participation of racial and ethnic minority population groups. This underrepresentation is compounding health disparities, with serious consequences for underrepresented groups and for the nation. At the request of Congress, Improving Representation in Clin",

          "description": "Randomized clinical trials are the primary tool for evaluating new medical interventions. Randomization provides for a fair comparison between treatment and control groups, balancing out, on average, distributions of known and unknown factors among the participants. Unfortunately, these studies often lack a substantial percentage of data. This missing data reduces the benefit provided by the randomization and introduces potential biases in the comparison of the treatment groups. Missing data can arise for a variety of reasons, including the inability or unwillingness of participants to meet appointments for evaluation. And in some studies, some or all of data collection ceases when participants discontinue study treatment. Existing guidelines for the design and conduct of clinical trials, and the analysis of the resulting data, provide only limited advice on how to handle missing data. Thus, approaches to the analysis of data with an appreciable amount of missing values tend to be ad h",

The DOE Exascale Computing Project (ECP)2 has developed new applications capabilities, parallelization approaches, and software tools, while co-developing the computing systems in collaboration with vendor partners. The NNSA is positioned to take full advantage of exascale computing, but demand for more computing will continue to grow beyond exascale, driven by both familiar applications and new mission drivers and new computational approaches that will use high-end computing. Visionary leaders and creativity will be needed to move existing codes to next-generation platforms, to reconsider the use of advanced computing for current and emerging mission problems, and to envision new types of computing systems, algorithmic techniques implemented in software, partnerships, and models",

Nurses work in a wide array of settings and practice at a range of professional levels. They are often the first and most frequent line of contact with people of all backgrounds and experiences seeking care and they represent the largest of the health care professions. A nation cannot fully thrive until everyone - no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they make - can live their healthiest possible life, and helping people live their healthiest life is and has always been the essential role of nurses. Nurses have a critical role to play in achieving the goal of health equity, but they need robust education, supportive work environments, and autonomy. Accordingly, at the request of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, on behalf of the National Academy of Medicine, an ad hoc committee under the auspices",

In almost every outcome related to social, emotional, behavioral, educational, mental, physical, and economic health and well-being, families identifying as Black, Latino, and Native American, and those with low incomes, have disproportionately borne the brunt of the negative effects of the pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children and families will be felt for years to come. While these long-term effects are unknown, they are likely to have particularly significant implications for children and families from racially and ethnically minoritized communities and with low incomes.

They are deeply curious about the world around them and eager to investigate the many questions they have about their environment. Educators can develop learning environments that support the development and demonstration of proficiencies in science and engineering, including making connections across the contexts of learning, which can help children see their ideas, interests, and practices as meaningful not just for school, but also in their lives. Unfortunately, in many preschool and elementary schools science gets relatively little attention compared to English language arts and mathematics. In addition, many early childhood and elementary teachers do not have extensive grounding in science and engineering content.

At the same time, stronger approaches to reviewing and synthesizing scientific evidence have evolved, such that there are now established protocols for developing evidence-based health recommendations. However, not all authoritative bodies have used such approaches for developing infant feeding guidance, and for many feeding questions there is little or no sound evidence available to guide best practices, despite the fact that research on infant and young child feeding has expanded in recent decades. Summarizing the current landscape of feeding recommendations for infants and young children can reveal the level of consistency of existing guidance, shed light on the types of evidence that underpin each recommendation, and provide insight into the feasibility of harmonizing guidelines.
