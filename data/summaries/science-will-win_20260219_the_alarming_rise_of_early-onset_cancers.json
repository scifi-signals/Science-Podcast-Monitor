  "summary": "This episode of Science Will Win examines the alarming rise of early-onset cancers (diagnosed before age 50), particularly colorectal cancer in young adults. The hosts present personal narratives alongside expert commentary from oncologists at Pfizer, revealing a 79% increase in early-onset cancers from 1990-2019, with colorectal cancer now the leading cause of cancer death in men under 50. While dietary factors, alcohol use, and tobacco consumption may contribute, no single causative agent has been identified. The episode emphasizes the need for earlier screening (now recommended starting at age 45), improved healthcare access for young people, and specialized psychosocial support addressing unique challenges young cancer patients face, including impacts on fertility, career, and body image.",

While survival rates for some pediatric cancers present a story of success, for many types of pediatric cancers, little progress has been made. Many cancer treatments are known to cause not only significant acute side effects, but also lead to numerous long-term health risks and reduced quality of life. Even in cases where the cancer is considered curable, the consequences of treatment present substantial long-term health and psychosocial concerns for children, their families, their communities, and our health system.

The National Academies have provided a biennial review of CERP since 2004. This tenth biennial report in the series highlights significant recent restoration progress and offers guidance in three areas: applying Indigenous Knowledge in project planning, using modeling tools for understanding the effects of climate change on the CERP, and strengthening adaptive management for CERP decision making. Thanks to record state and federal investments in recent years, the pace of restoration implementation has reached historic levels and sizeable restoration benefits have been achieved.

          "description": "Childhood cancer is an area of oncology that has seen both remarkable progress as well as substantial continuing challenges. While survival rates for some pediatric cancers present a story of success, for many types of pediatric cancers, little progress has been made. Many cancer treatments are known to cause not only significant acute side effects, but also lead to numerous long-term health risks and reduced quality of life. Even in cases where the cancer is considered curable, the consequences of treatment present substantial long-term health and psychosocial concerns for children, their families, their communities, and our health system. To examine specific opportunities and suggestions for driving optimal care delivery supporting survival with high quality of life, the National Cancer Policy Forum of the Institute of Medicine and the American Cancer Society co-hosted a workshop which convened experts and members of the public on March 9 and 10, 2015. At this workshop, clinicians an",

          "description": "Every patient is unique, and the evolving field of precision medicine aims to ensure the delivery of the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. In an era of rapid advances in biomedicine and enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of disease, health care providers increasingly have access to advanced technologies that may identify molecular variations specific to an individual patient, which subsequently can be targeted for treatment. Known as biomarker tests for molecularly targeted therapies, these complex tests have the potential to enable the selection of the most beneficial treatment (and also to identify treatments that may be harmful or ineffective) for the molecular underpinnings of an individual patient's disease. Such tests are key to unlocking the promise of precision medicine. Biomarker tests for molecularly targeted therapies represent a crucial area of focus for developing methods that could later be applicable to other areas of precision medicine. Th",
