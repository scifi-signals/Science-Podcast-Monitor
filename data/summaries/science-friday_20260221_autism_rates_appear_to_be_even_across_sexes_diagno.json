  "summary": "A new Swedish epidemiological study challenges the long-held belief that autism is three times more common in boys than girls, finding instead that autism prevalence is roughly equal across sexes assigned at birth, but girls and women are diagnosed significantly later in life—often not until adolescence or adulthood. The research reveals that diagnostic criteria for autism were historically developed based on male presentations, leading to underdiagnosis in females who may mask or present autism differently. Researchers and clinicians discuss how delayed diagnoses profoundly affect people's lives, the need to update diagnostic criteria to be more neurodiversity-affirming, and the importance of recognizing autism as natural neurological variation rather than deficit.",

    "CDC reports autism is three times more common in boys than girls—study suggests this reflects diagnostic bias rather than true prevalence difference",
    "Swedish cohort study (1985-2022) found autism prevalence roughly equal by sex assigned at birth, with female-assigned individuals diagnosed later",
    "Average diagnosis age: 10-14 years for boys, 15-19 years for girls; by age 20, diagnosis rates reach 1:1 ratio",
    "Autistic girls show equal social understanding difficulties as autistic boys but appear more socially proficient outwardly",
    "Autism diagnostic criteria were historically based on male case descriptions, potentially biasing interpretation toward male presentations",
    "Autistic girls more likely to have interests appearing relational/social rather than highly specific objects, making autism less noticeable"

  "key_quotes": [
    "The prevalence of autism is actually pretty even across the sexes, but people with female stamped on their birth certificate are often diagnosed later in life.",
    "I grew up believing that there was fundamentally something deeply bad and rotten about myself... Getting a diagnosis is like vindication. It's like a verdict of not guilty.",
    "It's so important that the world stops seeing autism as a deficit and instead sees that autistic people have always been here and they always will be. It's a natural type of neurological variety."

          "description": "Obesity has come to the forefront of the American public health agenda. The increased attention has led to a growing interest in quantifying obesity prevalence and determining how the prevalence has changed over time. Estimates of obesity prevalence and trends are fundamental to understanding and describing the scope of issue. Policy makers, program planners, and other stakeholders at the national, state, and local levels are among those who search for estimates relevant to their population(s) of interest to inform their decision-making. The differences in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data have given rise to a body of evidence that is inconsistent and has created barriers to interpreting and applying published reports. As such, there is a need to provide guidance to those who seek to better understand and use estimates of obesity prevalence and trends. Assessing Prevalence and Trends in Obesity examines the approaches to data collection, analysis, and interpretation ",

This provides a critical foundation for lifelong progress, and the adults who provide for the care and the education of young children bear a great responsibility for their health, development, and learning. Despite the fact that they share the same objective - to nurture young children and secure their future success - the various practitioners who contribute to the care and the education of children from birth through age 8 are not acknowledged as a workforce unified by the common knowledge and competencies needed to do their jobs well. Transforming the Workforce for Children Birth Through Age 8 explores the science of child development, particularly looking at implications for the professionals who work with children. This report examines the current capacities and practices of the workforce, the settings in which they work, the policies and infrastructure that set qualifications",

Criteria for Selecting the Leading Health Indicators for Healthy People 2030 makes recommendations for the development of Leading Health Indicators for the initiative's Healthy People 2030 framework. The authoring committee's assessments inform their recommendations for the Healthy People Federal Interagency Workgroup in their endeavor to develop the latest Leading Health Indicators. The finalized Leading Health Indicators will establish the criteria for healthy Americans and help update policies that will guide decision-marking throughout the next decade.

To achieve these goals, EnCoRe will support long-term, multiyear community engagement projects that partner directly with select communities across the Gulf region and Alaska. This report develops findings and recommendations intended to help guide EnCoRe in identifying, selecting, and engaging with communities as it moves forward with the initiative.

The workshops focused on two broad areas: (1) mitigation (behavioral elements of a strategy to reduce the net future human influence on climate) and (2) adaptation (behavioral and social determinants of societal capacity to minimize the damage from climate changes that are not avoided). Facilitating Climate Change Responses documents the information presented in the workshop presentations and discussions. This material illustrates some of the ways the behavioral and social sciences can contribute to the new era of climate research.",

Forecasts of snow and ice storms, hurricanes and storm surge, extreme heat, and other severe weather events are made with greater accuracy, geographic specificity, and lead time to allow people and communities to take appropriate protective measures. Yet hazardous weather continues to cause loss of life and result in other preventable social costs. There is growing recognition that a host of social and behavioral factors affect how we prepare for, observe, predict, respond to, and are impacted by weather hazards. For example, an individual's response to a severe weather event may depend on their understanding of the forecast, prior experience with severe weather, concerns about their other family members or property, their capacity to take the recommended protective actions, and numerous other factors. Indeed, it is these factors that can determine whether or not a potential hazar",
