  "summary": "This episode tells the story of Sarah and Ross Gray, who gave birth to identical twins in 2010—one with anencephaly (a fatal neural tube defect) who lived only six days. After Thomas's death, his donated tissues and organs (blood, liver, eyes) were used in medical research. Years later, Sarah and Ross embarked on a quest to discover how Thomas's donations were used, visiting research institutions to trace his biological legacy and find meaning in their loss.",

    "I've had this feeling that I'm not the boat, I'm the ocean. Like, the decisions that I make are changing other people as opposed to just, I'm a boat getting slapped with waves all the time. That's made me feel powerful."

One specific type of stem cell, the hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC), which is derived from umbilical cord blood (as well as adult bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood), holds particular promise. To make the most of these HPCs, the Institute of Medicine was asked to consider the optimal structure for a national cord blood program and to address pertinent issues related to maximizing the potential of stem cell technology. Cord Blood: Establishing a National Hematopoietic Stem Cell Bank Program examines: The role of cord blood in stem cell transplantation The current status of blood banks already in existence The optimal structure for the cord blood program The current use and utility of cord blood for stem cell transplants The best way to advance the use of cord blood units and make them available for research Expert advice from leaders in the fields of economics, public heal",

However, a well-designed and supported MSW recycling programs hold many economic and environmental benefits. This report, produced at the request of Congress, reviews available information on MSW recycling programs in municipal, county, state, and tribal governments and provides advice on potential policy options for more effective implementation. Municipal Solid Waste Recycling in the United States explores the contemporary issues facing MSW recycling programs and lays out recommendations and policy options to chart a path forward.

While survival rates for some pediatric cancers present a story of success, for many types of pediatric cancers, little progress has been made. Many cancer treatments are known to cause not only significant acute side effects, but also lead to numerous long-term health risks and reduced quality of life. Even in cases where the cancer is considered curable, the consequences of treatment present substantial long-term health and psychosocial concerns for children, their families, their communities, and our health system. To examine specific opportunities and suggestions for driving optimal care delivery supporting survival with high quality of life, the National Cancer Policy Forum of the Institute of Medicine and the American Cancer Society co-hosted a workshop which convened experts and members of the public on March 9 and 10, 2015.

But the barriers to students realizing their ambitions are reflected in the fact that about half of those with the intention to earn a STEM bachelor's degree and more than two-thirds intending to earn a STEM associate's degree fail to earn these degrees 4 to 6 years after their initial enrollment. Many of those who do obtain a degree take longer than the advertised length of the programs, thus raising the cost of their education. Are the STEM educational pathways any less efficient than for other fields of study? How might the losses be \"stemmed\" and greater efficiencies realized?
