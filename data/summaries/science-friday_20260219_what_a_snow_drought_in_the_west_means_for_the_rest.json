  "summary": "Science Friday explores the severe snow drought affecting the western United States, particularly Colorado and Utah, where snowpack levels are at historic lows comparable to 1976-77 and 1980-81. The episode examines how this crisis threatens water supplies for tens of millions of people across the West, with 95% of Utah's water coming from snowmelt, and discusses the broader implications for the Colorado River system, which is already stressed. Climate scientist Brad Udall explains that warmer temperatures (5°F above normal, driven by human-caused climate change) are compounding the problem, and that solving the water crisis will require fundamental changes to agriculture in the Southwest, difficult Colorado River negotiations among seven states, and likely federal intervention.",

    "Temperatures in the western US have been 5°F above normal since October, with December in Colorado seeing 10°F above normal (attributed to human-caused climate change)",
    "Current snowpack levels are among the two worst on record for the Colorado River, comparable to 1976-77 and 1980-81",
    "Las Vegas has reduced water use by one-third since 1980 while doubling its population through efficiency improvements",
    "Water efficiency measures in agriculture can paradoxically lead to increased water use rather than reductions due to return flows"

    "It's hard to overstate how important snow is for our water in Utah... The state estimates that 95% of our water supply for cities and communities comes from melting snow.",
    "So what you're going to see, I believe, is the federal government's going to impose a solution. And nobody's going to like that solution.",
    "In the case of the Colorado River, we've dug ourselves a really big hole here and it's going to take a whole lot of work to climb out of it."

There is a need to probe more deeply into how climate change impacts on the environment can create environmental stressors that, in turn, are having and/or have the potential to have significant impact on human health in a number of dimensions. In response to this need, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) has initiated an interagency Scientific Assessment on the Impacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States. The Assessment is intended to inform public health authorities, other planning and policy entities, and the general public.

Legionella occur naturally in water from many different environmental sources, but grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant conditions that can be found in engineered water systems such as cooling towers, building plumbing, and hot tubs. Humans are primarily exposed to Legionella through inhalation of contaminated aerosols into the respiratory system. Legionnaires' disease can be fatal, with between 3 and 33 percent of Legionella infections leading to death, and studies show the incidence of Legionnaires' disease in the United States increased five-fold from 2000 to 2017. Management of Legionella in Water Systems reviews the state of science on Legionella contamination of water systems, specifically the ecology and diagnosis. This report explores the process of transmission via water systems, quantification, prevention and control, and pol",

Despite significant progress in reducing the amount of oil in the sea from consumption, exploration, transportation, and production, risks remain. This report, the fourth in a series, documents the current state-of-knowledge on inputs, fates and effects of oil in the sea, reflecting almost 20 additional years of research, including long-term effects from spills such as the Exxon Valdez and a decade-long boom in oil spill science research following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The report finds that land-based sources of oil are the biggest input of oil to the sea, far outweighing other sources, and it also notes that the effects of chronic inputs on the marine environment, such as land-based runoff, are very different than that from an acute input, such as a spill. Steps to prevent chronic land-based oil inputs incl",
