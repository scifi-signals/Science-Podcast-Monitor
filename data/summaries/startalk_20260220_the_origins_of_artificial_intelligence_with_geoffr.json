  "summary": "Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI researcher and 2024 Nobel Prize winner, discusses the origins and trajectory of artificial intelligence with Neil deGrasse Tyson. The conversation covers the historical development of AI from the 1950s, the mechanics of neural networks and backpropagation, and the capabilities of large language models. Hinton addresses both the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, drug discovery, and other domains, and the existential risks posed by increasingly intelligent systems that may develop survival instincts and resist human control. The episode emphasizes that while AI offers tremendous benefits, humanity must urgently research how to ensure safe coexistence with superintelligent systems.",

We're all in the same boat when it comes to that.",

          "description": "Within the last two decades, Machine Learning (ML), the main subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has gained significant momentum across all sectors, driven by a confluence of factors: exponential growth in data generation, advancements in data storage and computing, and innovations in algorithmic techniques. Most notably and recently, the proliferation of deep learning (DL) methods and generative AI tools (GATs) such as ChatGPT are revolutionizing the business landscape. In an era where data is pouring in from new sources, the pace of data growth is exceeding the pace at which state and local Departments of Transportation (DOTs) are able to use it. NCHRP Research Report 1122: Implementing Machine Learning at State Departments of Transportation: A Guide, from TRB's National Cooperative Highway Research Program, serves as both an education and a decision-making tool to assist state DOTs and other transportation agencies in identifying promising ML applications; assessing costs, ben",

Citizen science projects focus on, but are not limited to, nonscientists participating in the processes of scientific research, with the intended goal of advancing and using scientific knowledge. A rich range of projects extend this focus in myriad directions, and the boundaries of citizen science as a field are not clearly delineated. Citizen science involves a growing community of professional practitioners, participants, and stakeholders, and a thriving collection of projects. While citizen science is often recognized for its potential to engage the public in science, it is also uniquely positioned to support and extend participants' learning in science. Contemporary understandings of science learning continue to advance. Indeed, modern theories of learning recognize that science learning is complex and multifaceted.

Therefore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) should continue to increase air traffic controller hiring, improve training success rates, incentivize transfers from overstaffed to understaffed airports, and implement robust fatigue management systems and efficient shift-scheduling tools. FAA should also rebuild its controller staffing based on its traditional modeling approach--as refined by needed updates and with local input--rather than adopting newer facility staffing models the agency developed collaboratively with members of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. FAA should also conduct recommended research to improve understanding about the relationship between facility staffing levels and safety and validate its facility models using risk indicators, some of which are confidential and therefore not available to the committee that prepared the report.These are among the recomm",

Although these actions are often viewed in terms of human public health, they also challenge the plant and animal health communities. Surveillance, defined as \"the continual scrutiny of all aspects of occurrence and spread of a disease that are pertinent to effective control\", involves the \"systematic collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination of health data.\" Disease detection and diagnosis is the act of discovering a novel, emerging, or reemerging disease or disease event and identifying its cause.
