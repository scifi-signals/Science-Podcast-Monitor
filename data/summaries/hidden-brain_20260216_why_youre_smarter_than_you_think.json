  "summary": "This Hidden Brain episode explores intelligence testing through the personal story of psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman, who was labeled as having low IQ as a child despite later becoming a successful researcher. The episode examines how IQ tests were originally designed by Alfred Binet to identify students needing remediation, but were misappropriated in America to sort and rank people by innate intelligence. Kaufman discusses how intelligence is far more complex and multifaceted than IQ tests capture, including implicit learning, creativity, and social intelligence. The episode challenges assumptions about human potential and the limitations of standardized testing.",

  "claims_to_note": [
    "Alfred Binet explicitly stated his test was NOT designed to measure innate intelligence, only current educational needs - this is well-documented in historical records",
    "American psychologists (particularly Louis Terman) transformed Binet's test into a tool for identifying gifted children and ranking people by presumed innate ability, contrary to Binet's original intent",
    "IQ scores correlate with various life outcomes (income, education attainment, health), which Kaufman acknowledges as scientifically supported",
    "Implicit learning (ability to learn probabilistic patterns unconsciously) is virtually uncorrelated with IQ scores",
    "People strong in explicit logical reasoning may sometimes be weaker in implicit pattern learning, suggesting a potential trade-off between cognitive abilities",
    "Kaufman scored 87-89 on IQ tests as a child (which he notes would be below average) yet became a successful academic researcher and psychologist",
    "Processing speed deficits in childhood (from ear infections) were misinterpreted as low intelligence when they reflected an auditory processing issue"

While most food laws and regulations apply to infant formulas, they are also subject to additional requirements and manufacturer regulations for certain quality factors. These include an assessment of protein quality and demonstration that the formula supports normal infant physical growth. Per the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked the National Academies to examine and report on the state of the science regarding methodologies for assessing the biological quality of protein in infant formula and the ability of infant formula to support normal physical growth. The committee's statement of task noted that its analysis should include the examination of current study designs and methods that could demonstrate quality factors have been met.

Drawing on a vast array of work from neuroscience to classroom observation, Taking Science to School provides a comprehensive picture of what we know about teaching and learning science from kindergarten through eighth grade. By looking at a broad range of questions, this book provides a basic foundation for guiding science teaching and supporting students in their learning. Taking Science to School answers such questions as: When do children begin to learn about science? Are there critical stages in a child's development of such scientific concepts as mass or animate objects? What role does nonschool learning play in children's knowledge of science? How can science education capitalize on children's natural curiosity? What are the best tasks for books, lectures, and hands-on learning? How can teachers be taught to teach science? The book also provides a detailed examination of how we know what we k",

          "description": "Adolescence is a crucial period of life for the prevention of substance use disorders. Research has shown that early intervention can significantly reduce rates of substance use disorder in adulthood. To learn more about effective family-focused interventions in primary care settings for preventing substance use disorder, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine hosted a workshop on May 5-6, 2022. The proceedings from that workshop explores existing efforts to incorporate family-focused interventions into state health care policies. It also examines barriers to implementing such interventions as well as lessons learned from successful efforts to scale up these interventions.",

Because connective tissue is found throughout the body, the impairments associated with HDCTs manifest in multiple body systems and may change or vary in severity throughout an affected individual's lifetime. In some cases, these impairments may be severe enough to qualify an eligible child or adult for monetary benefits through the U.S. Social Security Administration's (SSA's) Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income program. SSA asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to convene an expert committee that would provide current information regarding the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of selected HDCTs, including Marfan syndrome and the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, and the effect of the disorders and their treatment on functioning.

          "description": "Behavioral health and substance use disorders affect approximately 20 percent of the U.S. population. Of those with a substance use disorder, approximately 60 percent also have a mental health disorder. Together, these disorders account for a substantial burden of disability, have been associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality from other chronic illnesses, and can be risk factors for incarceration, homelessness, and death by suicide. In addition, they can compromise a person's ability to seek out and afford health care and adhere to treatment recommendations. To explore data, policies, practices, and systems that affect the diagnosis and provision of care for mental health and substance use disorders, the Health and Medicine Division of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine created the Forum on Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders. The forum activities are expected to advance the discussion and generate potential ideas on ways to address ",
